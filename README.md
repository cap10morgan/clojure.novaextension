# Clojure extension for Nova

## Current status

As of 2020-09-30 this is pretty basic. It adds simple syntax highlighting and
navigation in many (but not all) scenarios that Nova supports (e.g. jump to
definition of a function defined with a local `defn`).

I hope to add more support for additional syntax highlighting and symbolic
navigation (e.g. binding forms and requires) down the road.

And someday maybe even look into integrating parinfer and a REPL-based language
server.

Pull requests welcome!
